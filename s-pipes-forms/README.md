## Editing Test Source Code Annotated with Lombok
To edit the test source code annotated with lombok and take advantage of
the IntelliJ IDEA:
* Unmark `src/test/generated-test-sources` folder as `test source root`
* Mark `src/test/lombok` folder as `test source root`

When done editing test source code annotated with lombok revert folder marking.
